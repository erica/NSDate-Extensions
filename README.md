- I forked NSDate-Extensions because I found myself adding methods to it.  
-- 04-11-14 Added 5 methods for the part of day (morning, evening, afternoon and night)

**README**

I am often swamped, so updating this repository (sadly) tends to fall off my to-do list. I'm fixing it up now in preparation for the iOS 6 Cookbook. 

I have changed all the uints to ints, fixed the year/week bug, added a few methods by user request.

Because I have the attention span of a flea, if you want to see anything fixed/added/whatever, ping me **now**, when I can spare the time to attend to it.

Thank you to everyone using the repository and sending me lovely pull requests and feedback. Even if I fail to respond in any timely matter, I appreciate it enormously.
